Panacea Project  
---
### What it is?
Panacea Project is project aiming to create programming language compiling
to custom binary file interpreted by virtual machine written in Rust programming language.  

I want this language to be a little bit like Elixir, but with easier Python-like syntax.

### Why?
I want to explore how programming works on lower level, and at the same time
do something, that might enhance my portfolio.

### Todo:
[x] Custom bytecode parser  
[x] Virtual machine interpreting bytecode  
[ ] Custom assembly language compiling to custom bytecode  
[ ] Compiler for custom assembly  
[ ] Custom programming language compiling to custom assembly  
[ ] Compiler for custom language  
[ ] Probably much more...
