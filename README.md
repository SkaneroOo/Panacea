Rustlang Project  
---
### What it is?
Rustlang Project is project aiming to create programming language compiling
to custom binary file interpreted by virtual machine written in Rust programming language.

### Why?
I want to explore how programming works on lower level, and at the same time
do something, that might enhance my portfolio.

### Todo:
[ ] Custom bytecode parser  
[ ] Virtual machine interpreting bytecode  
[ ] Custom assembly language compiling to custom bytecode  
[ ] Compiler for custom assembly  
[ ] Custom programming language compiling to custom assembly  
[ ] Compiler for custom language  
[ ] Probably much more...
